## Example of Working with Remotes
1. Add a remote to your local repository
  ```
  git remote add origin https://github.com/touchtool/example.git
  ```

2. Push some work **and** tell git to use this as the "default" **upstream** repository:
   ``` 
   git ...
   ```
   
3. Next time (git know your default upstream) just type:
   ```
   git push
   ```
